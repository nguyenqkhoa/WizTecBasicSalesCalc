There must be at least 10 different products, each with their own price, option to apply a 10% VAT tax, and belonging to 1 of 3 groups. You are free to decide what the products, groups, and prices are. An example of products and groups might be: apple/produce/tax=yes, orange/produce/tax=yes, chips/sundries/tax=no, windshield fluid/vehicle/tax=yes, etc
When a product is selected, it is added to the current transaction. The transaction must support up to 10 different products, listing product and price, and calculating subtotal, VAT, and total
A cancel or void button which, when pressed, clears and restarts the sale
A save or export button which, when pressed, saves or exports the current transaction in a JSON, XML, or text format. - Still needs to be implemented
