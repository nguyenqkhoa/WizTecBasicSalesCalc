# WizTecBasicSalesCalc
Coding assessment from coding assessment to make a sales calculator

An interface showing products, the transaction, subtotal amount, tax amount, the final amount, a cancel/void button, and a save/export button. An example layout is as follows but youâ€™re free to create it as you see fit

There must be at least 10 different products, each with their own price, option to apply a 10% VAT tax, and belonging to 1 of 3 groups. You are free to decide what the products, groups, and prices are. An example of products and groups might be: apple/produce/tax=yes, orange/produce/tax=yes, chips/sundries/tax=no, windshield fluid/vehicle/tax=yes, etc

When a product is selected, it is added to the current transaction. The transaction must support up to 10 different products, listing product and price, and calculating subtotal, VAT, and total

A cancel or void button which, when pressed, clears and restarts the sale

A save or export button which, when pressed, saves or exports the current transaction in a JSON, XML, or text format. - Implemented if opened with visual studio 2019+


To run: Clone the reposistory in visual studio 2019 (or above), build and run.

Export button will place the text and xml files under \source\repos\WizTecBasicSalesCalc\bin\Build\netcoreapp3.1

It is possible to download the reposistory as a zip file and open to WizTecBasicSalesCalc-master\WizTecBasicSalesCalc and open the WizTecBasicSalesCalc.exe application but the export function does not work.
